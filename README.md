A deeply inane Discord bot, created for the sole purpose of moderating a "word of the day" channel on my Discord server. Since the group rule on the server is that we aren't allowed to reuse words of the day (ever), it checks to see if a word (or a similar form of that word, e.g. chauvinistic -> chauvinist) has already been used as someone's word of the day and dings the user for their transgression.
